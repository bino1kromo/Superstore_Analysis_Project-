## Overview
The Superstore Analysis Project is an analytical project developed using R to explore and gain insights from retail data. This project aimed to analyze sales data from a superstore using interactive data visualization techniques. The main focus of the analysis was to understand sales patterns, delivery preferences, customer distribution, and the impact of discounts on profits. The project helped identify key trends and provided insights that can be used for better business decision-making.

- Libraries: tidyverse, lubridate, treemapify, waffle

## Project Workflow
1. Data Import & Cleaning: The dataset is imported and cleaned using tidyverse. Missing values are handled, and data types are standardized for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted to understand the structure of the data and identify key trends and patterns. This includes visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, histograms, and heatmaps.
3. Data Visualization: Creation of various plots to highlight insights on sales trends, product performance, regional sales, and customer behavior.
4. Statistical Analysis: Additional analysis such as correlation and hypothesis testing to draw more in-depth conclusions.
5. Reporting & Recommendations: Summarization of findings and actionable insights to guide business decisions.
